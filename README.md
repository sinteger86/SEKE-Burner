# SEKE-Burner
A project aimed at designing a toolhead for the Creality Ender 3 V3 SE &amp; KE models with sensors, a cutter, and nozzle LED(s)

A special thanks goes out to Malaise92 (https://www.printables.com/@malaise_2833889) over on Printables, this project is based heavily on their Sprite Extruder Filament Cutter: https://www.printables.com/model/1149345-sprite-extruder-filament-cutter

I am not a 3D modeler by any means. I picked out several features and models that support those features that others have already made and am in the process of merging them into a single cohesive toolhead project. I mainly use TinkerCAD or SketchUp for my modeling.

Currently, development is prioritizing:

1) Filament Cutter
2) Filament Sensor(s)
3) Nozzle LEDs
4) Fan shroud/package to tie it all together
